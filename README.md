Project Title: BMS College Canteen Ordering System

Description:
This project aims to streamline the food ordering process at BMS College of Engineering by developing a web application for canteens on campus. The motivation behind this initiative is to address the issue of long queues and chaotic rush during break times, where students often find themselves spending a significant portion of their break waiting to place an order.

The proposed solution involves creating a user-friendly website that allows students to place food orders online. By doing so, students can minimize their wait time and make the most of their limited break period. The system will notify users when their food is ready for pickup, ensuring a more efficient and convenient dining experience.

Additionally, this system benefits canteen staff by providing them with advance information on the orders before the break starts. This allows the canteen to prepare and manage their resources more effectively, leading to improved crowd management and faster service delivery.

Key Features:
1. Online food ordering for BMS College canteens.
2. User notifications for order status updates.
3. Efficient crowd management for canteen staff.
4. Improved overall dining experience for students.
5. GitHub repository for collaborative development and version control.

By uploading the code on GitHub, we aim to encourage collaboration, contributions, and continuous improvement of the system to better serve the needs of the BMS College community.
